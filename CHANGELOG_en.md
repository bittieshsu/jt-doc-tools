## [1.14.94] - 2026-09-05

### Word count now accepts office documents

`.doc` / `.docx` / `.odt`, `.xls` / `.xlsx` / `.ods`, `.ppt` / `.pptx` / `.odp` —
**converted to PDF first, then counted**. That way the page count and per-page
figures match what actually prints, and the existing PDF counting path is reused.
Reading the XML directly would be faster but gives no page count, and paragraphs
and line breaks would differ from the laid-out document.

A failed conversion returns **400** (corrupt file, or no Office engine), never 500;
the test is “did we get a usable file”, not soffice's exit code.

### Interface fixes

- The English label `Authentication realm` on the sign-in page was clipped by the
  fixed-width label column — shortened to `Realm`.
- Finished translating the sentences in shared components that inline markup had
  split apart (LLM service notice, missing-Chinese-font warning, the background-job
  “you can close this page” hint).

### English README and change log

`README_en.md` and this file, each with a language switch on the first line; the
Chinese files keep their names.

`README_en.md` is **generated** the same way the introduction site is
(`github/build-i18n-md.py`, line by line against `docs/i18n/readme.en.json`, code
blocks left untouched) — one document maintained by hand in two places always
drifts, and this project has paid for that several times. This change log is a
**summary**: the Chinese one covers 724 releases over six thousand lines, which is
neither useful nor maintainable to translate in full.

### The README's pytest badge had been stale for many releases

It read **470 passed**; the real figure is 5,951. A new gate
(`test_readme_pytest_badge_is_not_stale`) requires the badge to be **no lower than
the number of `def test_` definitions in `tests/`** — deliberately one-sided, since
parameterisation only ever adds cases, so a badge below the definition count is
certainly stale and can never be a false positive.

## [1.14.93] - 2026-09-04

### The introduction site and API manual are available in English

`docs/index-en.html` and `docs/api-en.html`, with a language link in the navigation
of each pointing at the other.

**They are generated, not maintained by hand.** The same document kept in two
places always drifts. The Chinese page stays the single source of truth, and
`github/build-i18n-page.py` extracts the translatable strings and produces the
English page from a catalogue.

### Locale-restricted tools are greyed out rather than hidden

Nine tools are built for Chinese / Taiwanese documents and conventions (company ID
lookup, e-invoice processing, travel receipts, pre-submission check, auto-fill
forms, both redaction tools, seam stamp, stamp and sign). In a non-Chinese
interface they are still listed, but greyed out, not clickable, and not pinnable,
with a tooltip explaining why. Seeing that a tool exists and why it cannot be used
is easier to understand than the tool disappearing.

### Interface language (i18n)

The shell is translated: sidebar, search, notifications, sign-in, two-step
verification, first-run setup, home page, my jobs, my workspace, and all 47 tool
names and descriptions. The language is chosen from the account menu or on the
sign-in page, and **only an explicit choice changes it** — browser language is
deliberately ignored, because switching to English also greys out those nine tools,
and nobody should lose access because of a browser setting they never chose.

## [1.14.87] - 2026-09-04

### Found the real cause of “20% of batches lose a segment”

Document translation batches were being judged as incomplete and retried — pure
waste, because the translation was there all along:

```
⟦<0xC2⟩5⟧5. New requirement - effective immediately   ← a stray <0xC2> inside the marker
```

`<0xC2>` is what a tokenizer emits, **as literal text**, for a byte that is not a
character. The marker no longer matched, that segment was not parsed, the whole
batch was judged incomplete, and a full generation was thrown away. Stripping
`<0x??>` before parsing fixed it: 3/3 parsed where it had been 0/3.

## [1.14.85] - 2026-09-03

### Document translation was dropping text colour

A spreadsheet cell containing “explanatory text + line break + a red italic note”
came back with the note in plain black. The translation had been written into the
paragraph's first text node, collapsing the whole cell to that node's style. There
was no error and the layout was unchanged — only a side-by-side comparison with the
original showed it, and that red “this is a new requirement” note was the point of
the document.

The translation is now written back **line by line where the runs allow it**, so
line-level colour, italics and bold survive.

## [1.14.67 – 1.14.83] - 2026-09-03

### New tool: document translation

Translate a whole office document into another language and get **the same format
and layout back** — only the text changes. Nine formats; the older binary formats
(.doc/.xls/.ppt) are converted to the modern one, translated, and converted back.
**PDF is not accepted**: a PDF has no paragraphs, its text is positioned fragments,
and replacing them with translations of a different length is bound to break the
layout.
